About This Project - Purpose & Cababilities: *This app is to show a ficticional sushi resturant in NYC. It is to demonstrate my ability to incorporate skills I have learned from a previous project. This project introduces new skills like using TabView, ScrollView, and LazyVGrid to better present this resturant. 

The Types of things I learned and implemented in doing this challenge: 

🛠️✅ I enjoyed learning how to build a Tab Feature with this mock resturant app project
🛠️✅ I learned how to intergrate features and code from one of my previous app projects (Menu App) into this project
🛠️✅ I found it very benefical build an app the utilizes Tab Navigation
🛠️✅ How to Grid layouts in the user interface (UI)
🛠️✅ How to use Scrollviews to allow users to see more
🛠️✅ How to display modal popups
🛠️✅ Passing Data between multiple screens (bindings)
🛠️✅ How to use code to dynamically generate user elements
    - gives another tool to display data on screen
    - help build custom list
🛠️✅ Dynamically Generating UI Elements using ForEach
🛠️✅ Building the About Screen (SwiftUI ScrollViews)
🛠️✅ learn how to use the **SwiftUI LazyVGrid** component to achieve a grid layout
🛠️✅ This project will be using LazyVGrid for our **Gallery view**
🛠️✅ Becasue we want a grid that grows vertically
🛠️✅ Plus all the cells are going to be the same size put all our photos into it
🛠️✅ Developed a Test project to test what I learned about creating a Grid in SwiftUI
🛠️✅ Set a Variable for all the sushi photos I wanted to display 
🛠️✅ Utilized ScrollView and placed my LazyVGrid within the ScrollView, Set 3 columns for the grid and spacing as well
🛠️✅  In Order to populate the images in my grid I use a **ForEach** and set the photos variable as my identifiable
🛠️✅  After resizing the images and setting an aspect ratio I was able to successfully display the 11 yummy sushi images

My Unique Modification to this Project:
-This project is part of an online iOS app development course I am taking. Most of the information is part of the course with some modifications I added for my own unique specifications I wanted this app to look like. For the first view I modified my own unique background color to the sushi menu. For the about section I created in my own way, collected my own image assets, and came up with a made up name, summary about the resturant, and address. This project was inspired by all the amazing sushi resturants I have visited with my wife as we journey to the city on our weekend adventures.
