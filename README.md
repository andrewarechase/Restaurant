About This Project - Purpose & Cababilities: *This app is to show a ficticional sushi resturant in NYC. It is to demonstrate my ability to incorporate skills I have learned from a previous project. This project introduces new skills like using TabView, ScrollView, and LazyVGrid to better present this resturant. 

The Types of things I learned and implemented in doing this challenge: 

游멆잺九 I enjoyed learning how to build a Tab Feature with this mock resturant app project
游멆잺九 I learned how to intergrate features and code from one of my previous app projects (Menu App) into this project
游멆잺九 I found it very benefical build an app the utilizes Tab Navigation
游멆잺九 How to Grid layouts in the user interface (UI)
游멆잺九 How to use Scrollviews to allow users to see more
游멆잺九 How to display modal popups
游멆잺九 Passing Data between multiple screens (bindings)
游멆잺九 How to use code to dynamically generate user elements
    - gives another tool to display data on screen
    - help build custom list
游멆잺九 Dynamically Generating UI Elements using ForEach
游멆잺九 Building the About Screen (SwiftUI ScrollViews)
游멆잺九맓earn how to use the **SwiftUI LazyVGrid** component to achieve a grid layout
游멆잺九This project will be using LazyVGrid for our **Gallery view**
游멆잺九Becasue we want a grid that grows vertically
游멆잺九Plus all the cells are going to be the same size put all our photos into it
游멆잺九Developed a Test project to test what I learned about creating a Grid in SwiftUI
游멆잺九Set a Variable for all the sushi photos I wanted to display 
游멆잺九Utilized ScrollView and placed my LazyVGrid within the ScrollView, Set 3 columns for the grid and spacing as well
游멆잺九 In Order to populate the images in my grid I use a **ForEach** and set the photos variable as my identifiable
游멆잺九 After resizing the images and setting an aspect ratio I was able to successfully display the 11 yummy sushi images

My Unique Modification to this Project:
-This project is part of an online iOS app development course I am taking. Most of the information is part of the course with some modifications I added for my own unique specifications I wanted this app to look like. For the first view I modified my own unique background color to the sushi menu. For the about section I created in my own way, collected my own image assets, and came up with a made up name, summary about the resturant, and address. This project was inspired by all the amazing sushi resturants I have visited with my wife as we journey to the city on our weekend adventures.
